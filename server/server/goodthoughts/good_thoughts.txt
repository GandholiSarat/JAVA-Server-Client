Every day may not be good, but there is something good in every day.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
If you want to lift yourself up, lift up someone else.
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.
